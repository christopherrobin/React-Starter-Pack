# React-Starter-Pack

This is my custom React Starter Pack, a constantly evolving collection of my favorite tools ready to be used to jump-start a new project. 

Default tooling includes: 
- Custom fetch and cookie management utility functions
- Custom ESLint configuration
- Custom Babel configuration without ejecting
- Material-UI core, lab, and icons
- Bootstrap (for the grid system)
- SASS
- Jest
- Lodash
- React-Helmet 
- Project initializes with 2 pages and a minimalist react-router-dom navigational example
